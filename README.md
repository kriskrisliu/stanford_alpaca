This is the repo for the Stanford Alpaca project, which aims to build and share an instruction-following LLaMA model. The repo contains:
- A [**web demo**](https://crfm.stanford.edu/alpaca/) to interact with our Alpaca model
- The [52K data](#data-release) used for fine-tuning the model
- The code for [generating the data](#data-generation-process)

## Overview

The current Alpaca model is fine-tuned from a 7B LLaMA model [1] on 52K instruction-following data generated by the techniques in the Self-Instruct [2] paper, with some modifications that we discuss in the next section.
In a preliminary human evaluation, we found that the Alpaca 7B model behaves similarly to the `text-davinci-003` model on the Self-Instruct instruction-following evaluation suite [2].

Alpaca is still under development, and there are many limitations that have to be addressed.
Importantly, we have not yet fine-tuned the Alpaca model to be safe and harmless.
We thus encourage users to be cautious when interacting with Alpaca, and to report any concerning behavior to help improve the safety and ethical considerations of the model.

Our initial release contains the data generation procedure, dataset, and training recipe. We intend to release the model weights if we are given permission to do so by the creators of LLaMA. For now, we have chosen to host a live demo to help readers better understand the capabilities and limits of Alpaca, as well as a way to help us better evaluate Alpaca's performance on a broader audience.

**Please read our release [blog post](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) for more details about the model, our discussion of the potential harm and limitations of Alpaca models, and our thought process for releasing a reproducible model.**

## Data Release
[`alpaca_data.json`](./alpaca_data.json) contains 52K instruction-following data we used for fine-tuning the Alpaca model.
This JSON file is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary contains the following fields:
- `instruction`: `str`, describes the task the model should perform. Each of the 52K instructions is unique.
- `input`: `str`, optional context or input for the task. For example, when the instruction is "Summarize the following article", the input is the article. Around 40% of the examples have an input.
- `output`: `str`, the answer to the instruction as generated by `text-davinci-003`.

We used the following prompts for fine-tuning the Alpaca model:
- for examples with a non-empty input field:
 ```
 Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
 
 ### Instruction:
 {instruction}
 
 ### Input:
 {input}
 
 ### Response:
 ```
- for examples with an empty input field:
 ```
 Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.
 
 ### Instruction:
 {instruction}
 
 ### Response:
 ```
 
 During inference (eg for the web demo), we use the user instruction with an empty input field (second option).

## Data Generation Process

<details>
<summary> <strong> Running the code </strong> </summary>

1. Set environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key.
2. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `python -m generate_instruction generate_instruction_following_data` to generate the data.

</details>

We built on the data generation pipeline from [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct) and made the following modifications:
- We used `text-davinci-003` to generate the instruction data instead of `davinci`.
- We wrote a new prompt (`prompt.txt`) that explicitly gave the requirement of instruction generation to `text-davinci-003`. Note: there is a slight error in the prompt we used, and future users should incorporate the edit in https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/pull/24
- We adopted much more aggressive batch decoding, i.e., generating 20 instructions at once, which significantly reduced the cost of data generation.
- We simplified the data generation pipeline by discarding the difference between classification and non-classification instructions.
- We only generated a single instance for each instruction, instead of 2 to 3 instances as in [1].

This produced an instruction-following dataset with 52K examples obtained at a much lower cost (less than $500). 
In a preliminary study, we also find our 52K generated data to be much more diverse than the data released by [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct/blob/main/data/seed_tasks.jsonl).
We plot the below figure (in the style of Figure 2 in the [self-instruct paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560) to demonstrate the diversity of our data.
The inner circle of the plot represents the root verb of the instructions, and the outer circle represents the direct objects.

## Fine-tuning
We fine-tune our models using standard Hugging Face training code with the following hyperparameters:

| Hyperparameter | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Batch size     | 128   |
| Learning rate  | 2e-5  |
| Epochs         | 3     |
| Max length     | 512   |
 | Weight decay   | 0     |

Given Hugging Face hasn't officially supported the LLaMA models, we fine-tuned LLaMA with Hugging Face's transformers library by installing it from a particular fork (i.e. this [PR](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/21955) to be merged).
The hash of the specific commit we installed was `68d640f7c368bcaaaecfc678f11908ebbd3d6176`.

To reproduce our fine-tuning runs for LLaMA, first install the requirements 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, install the particular fork of Hugging Face's transformers library.

Below is a command that fine-tunes LLaMA-7B with our dataset on a machine with 4 A100 80G GPUs in FSDP `full_shard` mode. 
We were able to reproduce a model of similar quality as the one we hosted in our demo with the following command using **Python 3.10**.
Replace `<your_random_port>` with a port of your own, `<your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer>` with the 
path to your converted checkpoint and tokenizer (following instructions in the PR), and `<your_output_dir>` with where you want to store your outputs.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \
    --model_name_or_path <your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer> \
    --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \
    --bf16 True \
    --output_dir <your_output_dir> \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \
    --evaluation_strategy "no" \
    --save_strategy "steps" \
    --save_steps 2000 \
    --save_total_limit 1 \
    --learning_rate 2e-5 \
    --weight_decay 0. \
    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \
    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \
    --logging_steps 1 \
    --fsdp "full_shard auto_wrap" \
    --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap 'LLaMADecoderLayer' \
    --tf32 True
```

The same script also works for OPT fine-tuning. Here's an example for fine-tuning OPT-6.7B

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \
    --model_name_or_path "facebook/opt-6.7b" \
    --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \
    --bf16 True \
    --output_dir <your_output_dir> \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \
    --evaluation_strategy "no" \
    --save_strategy "steps" \
    --save_steps 2000 \
    --save_total_limit 1 \
    --learning_rate 2e-5 \
    --weight_decay 0. \
    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \
    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \
    --logging_steps 1 \
    --fsdp "full_shard auto_wrap" \
    --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap 'OPTDecoderLayer' \
    --tf32 True
```

Note the given training script is meant to be simple and easy to use, and is not particularly optimized.
To run on more gpus, you may prefer to turn down `gradient_accumulation_steps` to keep a global batch size of 128. Global batch size has not been tested for optimality.
